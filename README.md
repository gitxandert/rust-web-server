# Rust Web Server

This server is sort of the capstone project of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). It features:

- HTTP parsing
- asynchronous request responses
- thread pooling
- graceful shutdown and cleanup

Opportunities for improvement include:

- multiple URI handling
- mulithreaded async I/O
- more particular error handling
