# Rust Web Server

This server is sort of the capstone project of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). It's my first larger, meaningful project in Rust, which I completed after working through the entire book in about a week and a half.

This project features:

- HTTP parsing
- asynchronous request responses
- thread pooling
- graceful shutdown and cleanup

Opportunities for improvement include:

- multiple URI handling
- mulithreaded async I/O
- more particular error handling

I'm also really keen on building my own runtime; look out for the implementation.
